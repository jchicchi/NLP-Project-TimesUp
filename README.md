# NLP-Project-TimesUp
This is an NLP Project examining the #TimesUp movement 

The main project files are the NLP_markdown RMD and PDF files. 

Prior to doing this NLP Project, I studied how to write for loops, if/else logic, and regular expression patterns; you can find this work in the For_loops file.

The For_loops RMarkdown file was not rendering when knitting to PDF, due to certain symbols included in the descriptive text, such as the modulus (%%) operator. Therefore, I have included a seperate PDF document for the For_loops file, which I manually created, for ease of viewing.
